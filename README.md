# Lab 8 - Starter

We are from Team 12, and we chose to partner up to complete this lab. Our names are Yunyi She and Ruoxuan Li. 

1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. Because this will speed up the testing process, and the test could be reused. Also, it is trigger everytime code is pushed, so it makes sure the code that gets pushed does not mess up the existing code on the branch.
2) no.
3) No because message feature is a feature that allows a user to write and send a message to another user, and unit test cannot test how individual components interact with each other on an application/feature level. 
4) Yes, because testing the max message length is not a component that interact with each other on an application/feature level.
